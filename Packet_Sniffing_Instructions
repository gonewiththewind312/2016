A few years after finishing CodeBreakers program you 
started working as a security consultant for a medium-size enterprise called HackMeNot Inc.
Getting a job was easy because after all you spend tremendous amount of time solving hacking and programming challenges.
The first task given to you at your security job is to do some forensics analysis ... a piece of cake for you.

A medium-sized company has contacted HackMeNot Inc. for help. Apparently, an attacker was able to exploit 
a web application written by a graduate of the very reputable Harward University. 
You find out that this developer also had a degree from the Midwestern Institute of Technology. 
"Didn't these people ever learn about systems security?", you think. In any case, 
forensic analysis showed that the attacker had started sniffers on the network. 
Fortunately (and unfortunately for the attacker ;-)), the information that the attacker 
had captured on the network was retrieved. Your objective is to find out which passwords were stolen by the attacker.
Go on, show your new boss what you are made of. Are you a CodeBreaker or what? ;)

Answer the following questions.
When you think you found an answer, feel free to call Aselya, Sarah or Aditi to check on your answer and solution;)
